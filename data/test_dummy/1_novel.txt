John had always been afraid of water. As a child, he nearly drowned in a lake 
    during a family vacation. The trauma stayed with him throughout his life.
    He avoided beaches, never learned to swim, and even felt anxious around pools.
    His friends knew never to invite him to water-related activities. Even taking 
    showers made him uncomfortable. The sight of large bodies of water triggered 
    panic attacks. He chose to live in landlocked cities far from oceans.
