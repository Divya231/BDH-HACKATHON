Michael hated reading and writing throughout school. He failed English classes
    repeatedly and never read books for pleasure. He had severe dyslexia that made
    writing extremely difficult. He pursued a career in mathematics instead, working
    as an accountant for most of his life. Words confused him and he avoided them.
