Emma was extremely shy as a child and had severe social anxiety. She was 
    bullied in elementary school when she had to give a presentation, which 
    traumatized her. Her parents tried therapy but her fear of public speaking 
    persisted into adulthood. She preferred working alone and communicating in writing.
