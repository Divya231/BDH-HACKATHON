Emma was terrified of public speaking. She would get physically ill before 
    presentations and avoided any situation where she had to speak to groups. In 
    meetings, she stayed silent even when she had valuable input. The thought of 
    giving a speech filled her with dread. She chose careers that didn't require 
    public speaking and declined all speaking invitations.
